# CO2-Emission-by-Vehicle-Prediction

CO₂ Emission by Vehicle Prediction
This machine learning project predicts the CO₂ emissions of vehicles based on engine specifications, fuel consumption, and other technical features. The goal is to build a model that helps in evaluating a car's environmental impact using its attributes.

📊 Problem Statement
As environmental concerns grow, it’s important to estimate how much carbon dioxide (CO₂) a vehicle emits based on its design and fuel efficiency. This project uses historical data of vehicles to predict their CO₂ emissions using regression techniques.
